# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge

I stumbled across the [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/) in the fall of 2020 and it looked like it could be fun. I had no idea how much fun it would be!

[KringleCon](https://kringlecon.com) includes the Holiday Hack Challenge and the associated talks, and it's going on my list of annual holiday musts. You should definitely check it out!
