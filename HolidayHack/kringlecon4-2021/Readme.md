# KringleCon 4: Calling Birds

I was pretty excited for KringleCon this year. It was so much fun last year, and I've been learning new skills all year so I was really looking forward to seeing if I could get further faster than I did last year!

But alas, my plans changed after I started looking around but before I could really get into the challenges. I got sick, and my family got sick, which pretty much put me in survival mode with just taking care of my family (Why is it that when the mom gets sick she still has to take care of all the other sick people in the house?) and making sure I didn't get behind with my normal workload as well as all the essential end-of-year tasks.

## The best thing about KringleCon, though, is that it's available year-round!

Stay tuned, because I'll be updating this write-up as I work through it!
