# Kringle Con 3: French Hens

Kringle Con 3: French Hens includes some great talks and the 2020 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge. I'll detail my experience here!

It's worth noting that I did not complete the entire challenge during KringleCon's up-time. I'm so glad they left it open so I could continue to work on it though! I'll start with what I've completed now that the challenge is technically over, then I'll add anything else I complete as it happens.
