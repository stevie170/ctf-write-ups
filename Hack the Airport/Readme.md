# [Hack the Airport](https://www.wicys.org/event/wicys-critical-infrastructure-affiliate-hack-the-airport-capture-the-flag-event/)

Presented by [Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) - Critical Infrastructure Affiliate](https://www.captechu.edu/student-experience/centers-and-labs/women-cybersecurity-critical-infrastructure-community), [Cyber Skyline](https://cyberskyline.com), [IntelliGenesis](https://intelligenesisllc.com), [Maryland Innovation & Security Institute](https://misi.tech), and others!

This was a fantastic event, held on September 1, 2021, and I'll add details over the next few days about what it was like and what I loved about it!

## Training

One of the awesome things about this event is the training that was held beforehand. Two days of virtual training sessions, with topics relevant to the upcoming CTF. 

## CTF Event

This was my first team-based CTF, and I loved the team aspect of it. I think if I had a little more of an idea what to expect beforehand, I would have done things a little bit differently, but that's the beauty of learning--aim for at least a little improvement with each try and over time it adds up!
