# CTF Write-ups

I recently completed my first successful hack, and not gonna lie... when I typed `whoami` and `root` showed up on the screen, I was on top of the world!

I will collect my CTF write-ups in this repository. 

If the box or challenge is ongoing, the write-up will go in an unpublished branch. Once the box is retired or the challenge is closed, I will make the write-up public.

### What is a CTF?

A *Capture the Flag* (CTF) competition is an information security competition that challenges participants to solve a variety of problems related to computer or information security. Sometimes the competition focuses on hacking, but not always; a CTF can include a mix of security-related challenges. The *flag* is often a text string that can be found through successfully completing a challenge. [This is an excellent description if you want to read further.](https://securityintelligence.com/behind-the-scenes-at-a-capture-the-flag-ctf-competition/)

### How to Get Started

If you'd like to capture some flags, here are a few resources to start with.

[tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com). - TryHackMe is a great place to start, with lots of tutorials and learning paths for even complete beginners.

[hackthebox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu) - Hack the Box is a little more advanced but there are quite a few practice boxes on this platform!

[Note Taking](https://youtu.be/yYmDQY1zKKE) - This is a great video with tips on taking notes. It's specifically geared toward the OSCP lab and exam, but the methodoligy is a great one to generalize to any capture the flag or pen-testing activities.
